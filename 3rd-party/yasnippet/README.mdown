# Intro

**YASnippet** is a template system for Emacs. It allows you to type an
abbreviation and automatically expand it into function
templates. Bundled language templates includes: C, C++, C#, Perl,
Python, Ruby,

SQL, LaTeX, HTML, CSS and more. The snippet syntax is inspired from
[TextMate's][textmate-snippets] syntax, you can even
[import][import-docs] most TextMate templates to YASnippet. Watch
[a demo on YouTube][youtube-demo] or download a
[higher resolution version][high-res-demo]

# Install with yasnippet-bundle.el

To quickly tryout YASnippet, download the simpler "bundle" version. 
If you plan to modify the bundled templates and/or build your own, 
download the "normal" package.
 
* Download `yasnippet-bundle` from the downloads section.

* You'll get a file named `yasnippet-bundle.el`, put it in
  `~/.emacs.d/plugins/` (create that directory if not exists).

* Open the file in Emacs, and type `M-x eval-buffer RET`.

That's it. Now open any file, you'll see a menu "YASnippet".  You can
pull down the menu to insert a template. Or, you can type a
pre-defined abbrev and press TAB to expand it!
 
To have Emacs load YASnippet automatically when it starts, put the
following in your ~/.emacs file:
     
    (add-to-list 'load-path
                 "~/.emacs.d/plugins")
    (require 'yasnippet-bundle)


# Install

To install the normal archive, download and unpack the latest
`yasnippet-x.y.z.tar.bz2`. You'll get a directory named
`yasnippet-x.y.z`, put it in some `~/.emacs.d/plugins` dir and add the
following in your `.emacs` file:

    (add-to-list 'load-path
                  "~/.emacs.d/plugins/yasnippet-x.y.z")
    (require 'yasnippet) ;; not yasnippet-bundle
    (yas/initialize)
    (yas/load-directory "~/.emacs.d/plugins/yasnippet-x.y.z/snippets")
