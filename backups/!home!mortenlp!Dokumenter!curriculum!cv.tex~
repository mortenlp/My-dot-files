  I was born and raised in Broager, which is a small city in southern
  Denmark, where I lived the first 20 years of my life, before moving
  to Aarhus to study Mathematics-Economics at the university. I have
  had an interest in mathematics for the most of my childhood, and it
  grew even stronger when I was in highschool. Add to this an overall
  interest in society and econmics and my choise of education was not
  difficult. I am currently writing my master thesis which I expect to
  finish this October.

  I currently live with my girlfriend Jeanne Andersen
  (Ph.D. student at Aarhus School of Business).

  In my spare time I enjoy sports a lot. In particular I go to a
  fitness center 5 times a week. Besides that I play the guitar and
  enjoy reading a good book.
