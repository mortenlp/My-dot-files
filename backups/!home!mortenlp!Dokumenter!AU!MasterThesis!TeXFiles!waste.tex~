\subsection{Intersection cuts}
\label{sec:intersection-cuts}

We will now see study polyhedra of the form
\begin{align*}
  C & = \{x \in \mathbb{R}^n : x= \bar{x} + \sum_{j \in J} r^j
  \mu_j \text{ and } \mu \geq 0_{\vert J \vert} \} \\
  & = \bar{x} + \text{cone} (\{r^j\}_{j \in J})
\end{align*}
where $J$ is a finite index set and $r^j \in \mathbb{R}^n$ for all $j
\in J$. The vectors $r^j$ will be called \emph{rays} to be consistent
with most convex analysis literature. Since $J$ is finite, $\text{cone}
(\{r^j\}_{j \in J})$ is a polyhedral cone and hence $C$ is a translate
of a polyhedral cone. We will later (Section ??\fxnote{Missing
  reference!!}) see that these objects can be used to describe the
split closure of a general polyhedron completely. With this in mind it
therefore makes sense to study translates of polyhedral cones in
depth.

First we will derive what is known as the \emph{intersection
  cut}. In order to better understand what is going on we will first
consider an example before generalizing the concepts.
\begin{ex}
  Let $\pi^T x \leq \pi_0 \vee \pi^T x \geq \pi_0 + 1$ with $(\pi^T,\pi_0)
  \in \Pi$ be an arbitrary split disjunction and consider the polytope
  of Figure \ref{fig:splitTransCone}(a). Note that it is a translate
  of a polyhedral cone.

    \caption{(a) A translate of a polyhedral cone, (b) an associated
      split disjunction and (c) the split cut and the disjunctive hull.}
    \label{fig:splitTransCone}
  \end{figure}
  Figure \ref{fig:splitTransCone}(b) shows the cone with the split
  disjunction and we see that it gives rise to two disjoint subsets
  which we will denote by $C_1^{\pi}$ and $C_2^{\pi}$, that is
  $C_1^{\pi} \vcentcolon = \{ x \in C : \pi^Tx \leq \pi_0\}$ and
  $C_2^{\pi} \vcentcolon = \{ x \in C : \pi^Tx \geq \pi_0 +
  1\}$. Figure \ref{fig:splitTransCone}(c) shows a cut and the
  disjunctive hull, $\conv (C_1^{\pi} \cup C_2^{\pi})$. As the drawing
  suggests the cut can be computed by finding the intersection points
  of the extreme rays with the disjunction and then compute the line
  that passes through them.
\end{ex}
We will now generalize the, somewhat intuitive, concepts from the
example. Let $\pi^T x \leq \pi_0 \vee \pi^T x \geq \pi_0 +1$, where
$(\pi, \pi_0) \in \Pi$ be an arbitrary split disjunction and let
$\bar{x} \in C$ be a point in $C$ satisfying $\pi_0 < \pi^T \bar{x} <
\pi_0 + 1$ (We will see later that this is the only interesting
case). For notational convenience we will refer to this disjunction as
$D (\pi,\pi_0)$. Define $\varepsilon_{\pi} \vcentcolon = \pi^T \bar{x}
- \pi_0$ to be the amount with which $\bar{x}$ violates $D (\pi,
\pi_0)$ and let, for $j\in J$ and $\alpha \geq 0$, $x^j (\alpha)
\vcentcolon = \bar{x} + \alpha r^j$. We are interested in finding the
smallest $\alpha$ such that $x^j (\alpha)$ satisfies $D
(\pi,\pi_0)$. These values of $\alpha$ can be computed by using the
following formula.
\begin{align}
  \label{eq:25}
  \alpha_{\pi}^j =
  \begin{cases}
    -\frac{\varepsilon_{\pi}}{\pi^T r^j}, &\text{if } \pi^T r^j < 0 \\
    \frac{1- \varepsilon_{\pi}}{\pi^T r^j}, &\text{if } \pi^T r^j > 0
    \\
    +\infty, &\text{if } \pi^T r^j = 0
  \end{cases}
\end{align}
This formula of course needs some explanation. We need to figure out
the value of $\alpha$ such that the halfline $\{\bar{x} + \alpha r^j :
\alpha \geq 0\}$ intersects one of the two hyperplanes $\{x \in
\mathbb{R}^n : \pi^T x = \pi_0 \}$ or $\{ x \in \mathbb{R}^n : \pi^T x
= \pi_0 + 1\}$. In other words we need to find the value of $\alpha$
such that $\pi^T x^j (\alpha) = \pi_0$ or $\pi^T x^j (\alpha) = \pi_0
+1$. So consider the following little calculation.
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:26}
  \pi^T x^j (\alpha) = \pi^T (\bar{x} + \alpha r^j) = \pi^T \bar{x} + \alpha \pi^T r^j
\end{equation}
We now consider the first case, that is assume $\pi^T r^j < 0$. Then
we get $\pi^T x^j (\alpha) = \pi_0$ for some value of $\alpha > 0$,
since also $\pi_0 < \pi^T \bar{x} < \pi_0 + 1$. This value can be
computed using \eqref{eq:26} in the following way.
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:27}
  \pi^T \bar{x} + \alpha \pi^T r^j = \pi_0 \Rightarrow \alpha =
  \frac{\pi_0 - \pi^T \bar{x}}{\pi^T r^j} =
  -\frac{\varepsilon_{\pi}}{\pi^T r^j}
\end{equation}
Similarly, if $\pi^T r^j > 0$, we must have $\pi^T x^j (\alpha) =
\pi_0 + 1$, for some value of $\alpha > 0$. As in \eqref{eq:27} we get,
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:28}
  \pi^T \bar{x} + \alpha \pi^T r^j = \pi_0 + 1 \Rightarrow \alpha =
  \frac{\pi_0 + 1 - \pi^T \bar{x}}{\pi^T r^j} =
  \frac{1-\varepsilon_{\pi}}{\pi^T r^j}
\end{equation}
In the last case ($\pi^T r^j = 0$), \eqref{eq:26} reduces to $\pi^T
x^j (\alpha) = \pi^T \bar{x}$. In other words $\pi^T x^j (\alpha)$
remains constant for all $\alpha \geq 0$ and therefore never
intersects either $\{x \in \mathbb{R}^n : \pi^T x = \pi_0 \}$ nor $\{
x \in \mathbb{R}^n : \pi^T x = \pi_0 + 1\}$. In that case we define
$\alpha_{\pi}^j \vcentcolon = +\infty$. The point $x^j
(\alpha_{\pi}^j)$ is called an \emph{intersection point}. Given these
intersection points, $x^j (\alpha_{\pi}^j), j \in J$ and a split
disjunction $D (\pi,\pi_0)$ we can compute what is known as the
\emph{intersection cut}, using the following formula. \fxnote{Check up
  on this formula! Is it right? How should it be understood?}
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:29}
  \sum_{j \in J} \frac{\mu_j}{\alpha_{\pi}^j} \geq 1
\end{equation}
The validity of this cut was shown by \cite{InterCutsANewType}. We
will however not present the proof here.

One of the really interesting things about the intersection cut is
that it gives a complete description of the disjunctive hull.
\begin{lemma}
  \label{lemma:intersect-descri}
  Let $\pi^T x \leq \pi_0 \vee \pi^T x \geq \pi_0 + 1$ with
  $(\pi,\pi_0) \in \Pi$ be a split disjunction. Then we have
  \begin{enumerate}[(i)]
  \item if $\pi^T \bar{x} \in ]\pi_0, \pi_0 + 1[$ then $\conv
    (C^{\pi}_1 \cup C^{\pi}_2) = C$
  \item if $\pi^T \bar{x} \notin ]\pi_0, \pi_0 + 1[$ then $\conv
    (C^{\pi}_1 \cup C^{\pi}_2) = \{ x \in C : x \text{ satisfies }
    \eqref{eq:29} \}$
  \end{enumerate}
\end{lemma}
Indeed we get from Lemma \ref{lemma:intersect-descri}$(ii)$ that
\eqref{eq:29} is all it takes to describe the disjunctive hull.

We will in the next part go through a lot of hard work
to prove this Lemma.
